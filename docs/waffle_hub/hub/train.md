# Train

After you [create `Hub`](./hub.md), you can train it using `Hub.train` method. As creating `Hub`, we provide same interface for training. Following example is training with `UltralyticsHub` and [Sample Dataset](../../waffle_utils/dataset/dataset.md) we've created.


<!-- """Start Train

Args:
    dataset_path (str): dataset path
    epochs (int, optional): number of epochs. None to use default. Defaults to None.
    batch_size (int, optional): batch size. None to use default. Defaults to None.
    image_size (Union[int, list[int]], optional): image size. None to use default. Defaults to None.
    learning_rate (float, optional): learning rate. None to use default. Defaults to None.
    letter_box (bool, optional): letter box. None to use default. Defaults to None.
    pretrained_model (str, optional): pretrained model. None to use default. Defaults to None.
    device (str, optional): device. "cpu" or "gpu_id". Defaults to "0".
    workers (int, optional): number of workers. Defaults to 2.
    seed (int, optional): random seed. Defaults to 0.
    verbose (bool, optional): verbose. Defaults to True.
    hold (bool, optional): hold process. Defaults to True.

Raises:
    FileExistsError: if trained artifact exists.
    FileNotFoundError: if can not detect appropriate dataset.
    ValueError: if can not detect appropriate dataset.
    e: something gone wrong with ultralytics

Returns:
    TrainCallback: train callback
