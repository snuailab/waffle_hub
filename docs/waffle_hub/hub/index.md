# Waffle Hub
`waffle_hub` provides same interface for various powerfull Deep Learning Frameworks. Here is our brief system architecture.

Each input and output adapter is responsible for converting our interface to the framework's interface. For example, [`Ultralytics`](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) uses `imgsz` for image size parameter, but [`detectron2`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) uses `IMAGE_SIZE`. So, we need to convert our interface to the framework's interface. `waffle_hub` provides `InputAdapter` and `OutputAdapter` for this purpose.
